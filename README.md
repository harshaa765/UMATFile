# ðŸ”§ Crystal Plasticity for FCC Metals â€“ Numerical Implementation

This repository contains code and material from my **M.Tech thesis**:  
**"Numerical Implementation of Crystal Plasticity for Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Metals"**.  

The implementation is based on the work of **Khan et al. (2016), International Journal of Plasticity**.  
It demonstrates the numerical formulation and input preparation for crystal plasticity simulations in FCC metals.
